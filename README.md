Concept website for music producers, vocalists, and engineers to meet each other.

Features: Login, Register, Search, Set Tags

Main usage:
Users will create an account, and assign tags to themselves (i.e. type of artist, and genres of music they make)

On the search page, they can set criteria for users they want to find, based on artist type and genres they make. Then, they will be shown a list of the corresponding users that match those requirements.
